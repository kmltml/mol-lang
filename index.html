        <h2>State</h2>

        <p>
          The state of a mol interpreter consists of a mixture, containing
          multiple molecules, and a set of reactions. A molecule is a
          sequence of atoms. An atom is any character except whitespace,
          dash (-), or capital letters.
        </p>

        <p>
          A reaction has a list of consumed molecules on the left side,
          and a list of produced molecules on the right side. Molecules
          are separated by whitespace. Sides of a reaction are separated
          by dash, or a unicode arrow character (â†’).
        </p>

        <h2>Program</h2>
        <p>
          The program consists of a list of instructions, each in a
          single line. There are two types of an instruction: molecules
          and reactions. Any molecules written in a line without a dash
          or arrow will be added to the initial mixture. Initial
          molecules may be written each in a separate line, written in a
          single line and separated by space or any combination of
          that. Any line containing dash or arrow defines a reaction,
          with left side before the arrow and the right side
          after. Molecules within a side are separated by whitespace.
        </p>

        <h2>Execution</h2>
        <p>
          The basic execution step consists of selecting a reaction and
          molecules from the mixture, that match the left side of the
          reaction. All molecules from the reaction must match a
          molecule in the mixture and every molecule must match exactly
          one from the reaction. Once everything is matched, the
          molecules corresponding to the left side of the reaction are
          removed from the mixture, and the molecules on the right side
          are added in. If multiple reactions can be applied, one is
          chosen randomly.
        </p>

        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>
          Molecules in a reaction can contain variables. They are
          represented by capital letters within the molecules. A
          variable at the last position within a molecule may match any
          number of atoms (including 0). A variable in any other place
          must match a single atom. Any variable appearing multiple
          times in the left side must match the same sequence of atoms
          for all instances. All variables appearing in the right side
          must have a corresponding variable on the left side, and get
          replaced by the matched atoms whenever the reaction gets
          applied.
        </p>

        <h2>Input/Output</h2>
        <p>
          There are two special atoms related to input and
          output. Whenever a molecule starting with the &lt; atom gets
          produced, a character gets output to the console. Number of
          atoms following the &lt; atom gets converted to the ascii code
          of the character to output. Type of those atoms doesn't affect
          anything. For input, a molecule starting with the &gt; atom
          must be produced. The interpreter will then wait for input,
          and replace that molecule with one containing whatever atoms
          followed the &gt; atom, repeated as many times, as the input
          character's ascii code. Whenever multiple input and output
          molecules get produced in the same step, output is always
          handled first, followed by input and only then any other
          reactions. The order within output and witin input is
          unspecified however.
